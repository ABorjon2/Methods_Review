        Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology, 48(5), 679-691. https://doi.org.10.1007/s10802-020-00618-7
* Summary: DuPaul et al. used the Rasch rating scale model to rate teacher and parent rating scale data to measure differing symptom dimensions. 
 Data was collected to go beyond prior investigation to measure invariance for child demographic characteristics at the symptom level. 
*Unit of Analysyis: Individual - 2079 chidlren ages 5-17
*Dealing with Missing Data: the author does not state how missing data was handled - most likely listwise deletion
*Stealing? the approach to add intersectionality to current research I would like to steal the model framework which highlights the differential item functioning of the 18 ADHD symptoms.
 I will also be looking at the differences in diagnosis based on race, gender, and class.

*Summary: passice longitudinal design that used secondary data analysis on the Family Life Project. Focuses on comorbidity between ADHD and ODD in early childhood. 
*Unit of Analysis: individual/families 878
*Dealing with Missing Data:lack of clarity in defining what constitutes exposure to IPV.Lee uses SPSS to analyze data through one-way ANCOVA. A regression analysis is also conducted. When insignificant interactions were deemed, they were dropped and effects examined without the interaction. 
*Stealing?:I would like to steal the regression model from this article. I will need to scale different points from interviews

*Unit of Analysis:Individual 1659 African American adolescents 
*Dealing with Missing Data:the uthor does not talk about dealing with missing data - most likely listwise deletion
